# Co_OPT-RCTs

This repository gathers code related to clinical trials which were undertaken around pregnancy interventions in which steroid use was used / recorded as part of standard treatment but was not a focus of the study. This work examines the data to assess it for inclusion in the Co_OPT IPD observational data meta-analysis if appropriate. 

Details from overarching [Co_OPT project website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/research/projects/co-opt) below:
* The initial focus of Co_OPT will be on antenatal corticosteroid treatment (ACT). The overall aim of the initial study, which will analyse data from Scottish Health Records in combination with anonymised routinely collected and observational data from a number of different sources (birth registries from other countries; data from observational cohort studies), is to undertake a robust evaluation of the short-term and long-term benefits and harms of antenatal corticosteroids given to mothers at risk of preterm birth, to determine to whom antenatal corticosteroids should be offered, and in what form. This will contribute to improving the health of pregnant women and their babies.
* The primary objective is to determine the safety of ACT in women and babies who are treated unnecessarily (deliver at term) or who receive inappropriately timed ACT (deliver >7 days after administration, when benefits are minimal) or questionably appropriate ACT (receive ACT >36 weeks gestation to cover early term birth, where there is less clear evidence of benefit).
* The secondary objective is to determine characteristics that influence maternal and infant outcomes following ACT, develop predictive models for their use and determine best formulation and dose regimens.
